* xkbcommon
the library which handles keyboard inputs in Xorg/Wayland display servers
** input devices
*** how to find input devices
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  for inputdev in /sys/class/input/input*/name; do cat "${inputdev}" | xargs -Ixxxx echo "${inputdev}: xxxx"; done
#+END_SRC

*** kernel scancodes and keycodes
**** hwdb
hwdb used to modify keyboard scan code at kernel level during boot using files in ~/etc/udev/hwdb.d~ generate mapping file using ~systemd-hwdb~ command
**** getkeycodes
~getkeycodes~ command used to show kernel's scancode-to-keycode mapping (VT required)
**** setkeycodes
~setkeycodes~ command used to set kernel's scancode to keycode mapping (VT required)
**** showkey
~showkey~ command used to show the current scancode or keycode when pressing the keys in keyboard (VT required), we need to wait for 10 seconds to exit this tool.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  showkey --scancodes
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  showkey --keycodes
#+END_SRC
**** evtest
~evtest~ is also used to show current keycode when pressing the keys in keyboard (no virtual terminal needed)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  evtest /dev/input/event2
#+END_SRC
*** console keymaps
**** loadkeys
~lodkeys~ command used to load keymap for console (VT required)
**** dumpkeys
~dumpkeys~ command used to show the current keymap of console (VT required)
** xkb keymaps
*** xkbcomp
~xkbcomp~ command used to retrive or set Xorg kemap, the below command will generate server-0.xkb file in the current directory from the current Xorg's loaded keymap
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xkbcomp :0
#+END_SRC
Edit the server-0.xkb file to suit your need, then load the edited xkb file back to Xorg server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xkbcomp server-0.xkb :0
#+END_SRC
*** =xkb_keycodes=â€‹
this section of xkb file defines kernel keycodes mapped to xkb keycodes (xkb-keycodes = kernel-keycodes + 8)
*** =xkb_types=
this section of xkb file defines Levels
*** =xkb_compatibility=
this section of xkb file defines how to interpret key combinations and set modifier states
*** =xkb_symbols=
this section of xkb file maps xkb keycodes to Keysyms, keysyms are the ones which are send to the end application where user interact.
*** MLVO notation
MLVO means Model, Layout, Variant, Option, this is how we load keymap into Xorg or Wayland display servers
*** localectl
~localectl~ command will help us show the current MLVO of the loaded keymap, also will show list of /Models/, /Layouts/, /Varients/ and /Options/ available
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  localectl status
#+END_SRC
*** get xkb file in Wayland Compositor
**** xkbcli
~xkbcli~ used to do various purposes related to xkb
below command will show the current xkb keycode from Xorg server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xkbcli interactive-x11
#+END_SRC
below command will show the current xkb keycode from Wayland server
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xkbcli interactive-wayland
#+END_SRC
below command is used to dump xkb keymap from current Wayland Compositor
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  xkbcli dump-keymap-wayland
#+END_SRC
*** load xkb file into Wayland Compositor
There is no generic command to load xkbfile into Wayland Compositor, different compositors uses different methods
**** Sway
place =input <keyboard> xkb_file <your-custom-xkb-file>= in your sway config file(=~/.config/sway/config=), then reload sway (Mod+Shift+c)
**** riverwm
Run this command to dymanically load custom xkb file into riverwm
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  riverctl keyboard-layout-file <your-custom-xkb-file>
#+END_SRC
